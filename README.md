**Tic Tac Toe Python Program**

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Python.  
The program allows two players to play the game on a 3x3 grid.  
Players take turns to mark 'X' or 'O' until one wins or the game ends in a draw.  
The game includes a check for winning conditions after each move.  
This project was created as part of my Programming Fundamentals Open Ended Lab.  
It was submitted to **"Sir Nadeem Pitafi"** for evaluation.  
The code is intended to demonstrate basic programming concepts and logic.
